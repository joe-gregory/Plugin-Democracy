# Plugin Democracy

## Introduction

We are **Plugin Democracy**, a non-profit organization that provides communities with the technological and legal tools necessary to operate as direct democracies.

Our initiative responds to a pressing need to revitalize democracy in the United States. Over the past few decades, the political system has experienced a significant decline due to the growing influence of money in politics, the rise of special interest groups, gerrymandering, voter suppression, and the influence of dark money. As a result, average citizens often find it difficult to have their voices heard and feel that their government no longer represents their interests.

## Our Solution

Against this backdrop, Plugin Democracy offers a promising alternative. Our platform enables citizens to participate directly in the political process, making their voices heard. It's a place where anyone can propose and vote on legislation, effectively influencing their communities and the country. We leverage technology to facilitate communication and collaboration, bypassing traditional power structures and empowering communities to shape their own futures.

## What is Plugin Democracy?

Plugin Democracy is a real-time, direct democracy system, highly customizable to accommodate the varying needs of different communities. In our platform:

- Anyone can propose new rules, amendments to existing rules, changes in administration, payroll alterations, propose community projects and events, and access the community's accounting.
- Citizens and residents don't need to wait for referendums or voting dates to make a change. They can impact their community at any given moment.
- The voting system is based on votes in favor. If a proposal is made, a citizen can "plug in" their vote. If enough votes are plugged in, the proposal passes. Conversely, support for existing laws can be withdrawn by "unplugging" your vote, all happening in real time.
